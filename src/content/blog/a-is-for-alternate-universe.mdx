## Encoding and Encryption

I occasionally come across the need to encode/decode a string to/from base64. Given that I primarily program using JavaScript, the `atob` and `btoa` functions have been my go-to.

For a long time I thought the names of these functions were strange. They seem like they are trying to be words &mdash; and that's what they were to me (each a single odd-sounding word) the first few times I used them<FootnoteTrigger index={1} /> &mdash; but I soon came to see them for what they were at face value: functions for converting from **A** to **B** and vice versa, but lowercased for reasons&trade;.

Having learned how to say the names of these functions out loud without embarrassing myself, the only thing left to close off the matter was to figure out what **A** and **B** were. Luckily for me, I already had the answer; introducing [Alice and Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob).

Briefly, Alice and Bob are a recurring pair of characters, often used in examples where messages are being sent over a network using some form of encryption. To my young programmer mind, encoding to base64 was not too distant a concept from encryption for me to jump to the conclusion that &mdash; where `atob` and `btoa` are concerned &mdash; **A** is for **Alice** and **B** is for **Bob**.

Over time, I developed the characters of Alice and Bob to match what the functions do. One of them was security-concious, encoding all the messages they sent. The other was care-free, sending plain text messages left and right. I could never remember which was which.

## Goodbye Alice and Bob

I've been trying for years to switch from using Postman to an alternative. Most attempts at switching have involved reading a few pages of documentation and scouring open issues on GitHub before culminating in an "I don't have time for this" rage quit<FootnoteTrigger index={2} />.

While embarking on my most recent attempt at switching off of Postman, I was reading through the Bruno docs and came across this [section regarding libraries that are built-in](https://docs.usebruno.com/scripting/inbuilt-libraries.html#inbuilt-libraries) and available for use when scripting:

<Image alt="atob - Turn base64-encoded ascii data back to binary. btoa - Turn binary data to base64-encoded ascii." src="bruno-libraries.png" />

The denial lasted a few seconds, but I've now successfully crossed over from an alternate universe into the one you and I currently live in, where **A** is for base64-encoded **ascii** and **B** is for **binary** string.
