  "This guide covers how to set up a WiFi hotspot on Linux using a single adapter. The scenario it aims to solve is one where only one device (for instance a laptop) is connected to a WiFi network that has a whitelist of permitted MAC addresses. The connected device can then be used to create a hotspot that other devices can connect to for internet access."

<StepHeading text="Installing create_ap" />

To create a WiFi hotspot, we will make use of a handy script available on GitHub. It can be installed on Ubuntu by running the following commands:

```
$$$ git clone https://github.com/oblique/create_ap
$$$ cd create_ap
$$$ make install
```

For other linux distros, take a look at the [installation guide](https://github.com/oblique/create_ap#installation).

<StepHeading text="Finding your wireless interface name" />

The next step (assuming your device is already connected to WiFi) is to find the name of your wireless interface. Run the following command in a console:

```
$$$ iwconfig | grep SSID | awk '{print $1}'
```

This should print out a list of network interfaces with a note beside the ones that do not have an active connection. Running the above command on my laptop gave me the following output:

```samp
enp9s0    no wireless extensions.

lo        no wireless extensions.

wlp8s0
```

Since I was connected to WiFi at the time, I was able to conclude that `wlp8s0` is the name of my wireless interface.

<StepHeading text="Launching the hotspot" />

The hotspot can then be launched by running the following command, filling in the relevant fields:

```
$$$ sudo create_ap _^wireless_interface$_ _^wireless_interface$_ _^hotspot_name$_ _^hotspot_password$_
```

In my case, the filled in command looks something like this:

```
$$$ sudo create_ap wlp8s0 wlp8s0 MyHotspot MyPassword
```

## Footnotes:
Since the script runs a process in the console, once the terminal is closed the hotspot will be closed as well. To circumvent this consider using a terminal multiplexer such as [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) or [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/), which allows you to close a terminal and still have it running in the background.
A simplified workflow using tmux is presented below:

- Create a tmux session called "hotspot".
  ```
  $$$ tmux new -s hotspot
  ```

- Run the hotspot (consider aliasing the command below).
  ```
  $$$ sudo create_ap _^wireless_interface$_ _^wireless_interface$_ _^hotspot_name$_ _^hotspot_password$_
  ```

- Enter your user password when prompted.

At this point you may close the terminal window. Alternatively, detach from the terminal by pressing <Kbd keys={["Ctrl", "B"]} /> followed by <Kbd keys={["D"]} />.
If you wish to stop the hotspot manually, run the following command in any terminal to kill the tmux session named __hotspot__:

```
$$$ tmux kill-session -t hotspot
```
