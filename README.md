# Odongo.xyz

This is the source code for [odongo.xyz][1] which is built on [Zola][2].

Feel free to send a [pull request][3] or open an [issue][4] if you notice any typos, wonky rendering issues, etc.

This project uses `pnpm`, which can be installed locally by running the following command:

```

It also uses a custom build of `zola` at version `0.14.0`. The only customisation that has been made is the addition of a custom theme ([Blackboard Pro](https://github.com/Croccifixio/blackboard-pro)) for syntax highlighting. The executable can be found in the `bin` directory.
